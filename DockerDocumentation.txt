DOCKER :


Docker is a container technology A tool for creating and managing resorcres. There are two main concepts in the docker, One is Containers and another one is Images.


IMAGES:


Images are one of the two core building blocks Docker is all about ( the other one is "Containers" ).

Images are blueprints / templates for containers. They are read-only and contain the application as well as the necessary application environment (operating system, runtimes, tools,...).

Images do not run themselves, instead, they can be executed as containers.

Images are either pre-built (e.g. official Images you find on DockerHub) or you build your own Images by defining a Dockerfile.

Dockerfiles contain instructions which are executed when an image is built ( docker build . ),every instruction then creates a layer in the image. Layers are used to efficiently rebuild and share images.

The CMD instruction is special: It's not executed when the image is built but when a container is created and started based on that image.



CONTAINERS:


1. Containers are the other key building block Docker is all about.

2. Containers are running instances of Images. When you create a container (via docker run ), a thin read-write layer is added on top of the Image.

3. Multiple Containers can therefore be started based on one and the same Image. All Containers run in isolation, i.e. they don't share any application state or written data.

4. You need to create and start a Container to start the application which is inside of a Container. So it's Containers which are in the end executed - both in development and production.
